## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**CSS Positioning and Layout**:
   - **Positioning with `absolute`**: Used position: absolute for placing elements in specific positions relative to their container or the viewport. Example: Centering the footer at the bottom of the screen using left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%).
   - **Offsetting Elements**: Leveraged top, left, and transform for fine-grained control over element placement.
   
**CSS Media Queries**:
   - **Mobile-first design**: Utilized min-width media queries to apply specific styles for larger screen sizes, ensuring a responsive layout from mobile to desktop. The **`min-width`** media query allows you to apply styles when the viewport is **larger than a specific width**, while **`max-width`** would apply styles for smaller screens.
   - **Order of Media Queries**: Placed media queries at the bottom of the CSS to maintain a logical flow, where base styles are defined first and overridden by specific rules for larger screens.

**CSS for Component Design**:
   - Applied styles like **border-radius** for rounded corners, **box-shadow** for card-like effects, and **border** for clean outlines.
   - Learned the importance of organizing code structure logically, ensuring that base styles come first, followed by more specific overrides for responsive design.


### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to experiment further with positioning and component designs for more interesting layouts.
